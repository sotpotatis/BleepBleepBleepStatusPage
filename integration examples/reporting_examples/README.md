# Reporting examples

This directory contains some example scripts for reporting different kinds of monitor data. The scripts are in most cases ready-to-go, you just have
to change a couple of variables. You can also use these as a base for your internal scripts.

There is also a library called `bleepbleepdata` that you can use to report data to a ***StatusPage instance.
