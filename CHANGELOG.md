# Changelog

This is the changelog for ***StatusPage.

### v1.0.0

* This is the initial release of ***StatusPage, and I'm *** happy about it! This release contains support for all the basic things that I expect in a status page.
Some things are on the wishlist, for sure (including reviewing TODO items), but I'm happy with it so far.
